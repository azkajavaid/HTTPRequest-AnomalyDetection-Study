### Anomaly Detection using HTTP Request Analysis 
This is an analysis of the 2010 HTTP Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC) (Spanish National Research Council) dataset to explore whether an HTTP request is normal or anomalous using features like the HTTP 
request method type, length of the content field, payload count, number of unique cookie ids per URL and number of unique index
counts per URL. Data wrangling and machine learning algorithms like decision trees and neural networks are performed in R. See Code.Rmd for project code, Presentation.Rmd and Presentation.pdf for presentation and ProjectExposition.Rmd and ProjectExposition.pdf for the writeup.
